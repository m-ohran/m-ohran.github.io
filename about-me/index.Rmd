#### I grew up in Orem, Utah, about 5 minutes away from Utah Valley University, where I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Bioinformatics. I'm passionate about learning, and have always been what my parents called a "math and science kid." I greatly enjoy problem solving and discovery. I credit my childhood love of dragons, dinosaurs, and all kinds of animals with being the first stepping stone towards my interest in Biology. I developed an intrerest in evolution and genomics, so UVU's Bioinformatics program was a natural fit. I've had the opportunity to get involved in undergraduate research, and have found that I really enjoy it.

### **Interests**

<br>

##### When I'm not working on school or research projects, I try to find time for fun things, like:
##### Reading: Mostly science fiction and fantasy, but I'm always open to recommendations!
##### Playing music: I'm a percussionist and pianist.
##### Listening to music: I've found artists and songs to enjoy in just about every genre.
##### Drawing: Some examples of my artwork can be found on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dragonrider109/)
##### Hanging out with my dogs, Brego and Shadowfax.
